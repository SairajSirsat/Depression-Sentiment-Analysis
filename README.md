# Depression-Sentiment-Analysis
Developed an NLP pipeline for depression detection on Twitter data using TF-IDF and ML models. Random Forest achieved 93.5% accuracy, with results published in a research paper highlighting applications in mental health monitoring and cybersecurity

This project focuses on analyzing and classifying depression-related sentiments from text data using **Machine Learning** techniques. The goal is to build a system that can identify depressive tendencies in written text, which can be useful in mental health monitoring and early detection.

## üìå Problem Statement
Mental health issues such as depression are often expressed through language on social media platforms, forums, and online communities. Detecting such signals in text can help in providing timely support and insights.  
This project attempts to classify text into **depressive** and **non-depressive** sentiments.

## üìÇ Dataset
- The dataset contains labeled text data related to depression and normal expressions.  
- Due to size/licensing constraints, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.  
- You can use datasets from:
  - [Kaggle - Depression and Mental Health Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
  - Reddit/Twitter scrapped datasets
  - Or any custom dataset of depressive vs. non-depressive text.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Text cleaning (removal of stopwords, punctuation, URLs, etc.)
   - Tokenization & Lemmatization
   - Handling class imbalance

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Bag of Words (BoW)
   - TF-IDF Vectorization

3. **Model Training**
   - Random Forest Classifier (primary model)
   - Performance compared with Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix & Classification Report

## üìä Results
- Random Forest achieved strong performance in identifying depressive sentiments.
- Example (you can update with your actual numbers):
  - Accuracy: **87%**
  - Precision: **85%**
  - Recall: **84%**
  - F1-score: **84%**

---

## üöÄ Future Work
- Implement advanced models like **LSTM** and **BERT** for deeper context understanding.
- Expand dataset to include multilingual depressive text.
- Deploy as a web app or API for real-world use.
